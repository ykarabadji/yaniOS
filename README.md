# yaniOS

Welcome to **yaniOS** â€” a personal journey into operating system development from scratch. This project is both a learning experience and an open invitation to anyone who shares the passion for low-level systems programming.

## ðŸŒŸ About the Project

**yaniOS** is a minimalist operating system built for x86 architectures, starting from the bootloader all the way up to a basic kernel written in C and Assembly. It's an experimental project aiming to explore:

- Boot sector programming
- Protected mode setup
- Writing a 32-bit kernel
- Memory management (coming soon)
- Basic I/O (keyboard, screen, etc.)
- File system exploration (future milestone)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To build and run the OS:

```bash
make
make run
```
