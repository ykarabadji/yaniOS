# yaniOS

Welcome to **yaniOS** â€” a personal journey into operating system development from scratch. This project is both a learning experience and an open invitation to anyone who shares the passion for low-level systems programming.

## ğŸŒŸ About the Project

**yaniOS** is a minimalist operating system built for x86 architectures, starting from the bootloader all the way up to a basic kernel written in C and Assembly. It's an experimental project aiming to explore:

- Boot sector programming   -> done 
- Protected mode setup      -> done
- keyboard driver           -> done
- Writing a 32-bit kernel   ->       i dont think if i can write this as done since im still working on its components
- Memory management         --------->       currently in progres
- basic file systeme
- shell commands parser 



## ğŸš€ Getting Started

To build and run the OS:

```bash
make
make run
```
